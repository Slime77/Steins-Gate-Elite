[name]???[line]「Hey, what are you mumbling about?」[%p]
There's no sound from the phone against my right ear. Only silence.[%p]
I am baking in the summer sun.[%p]
A bead of sweat slowly slides down my chin and drips onto the concrete.[%p]
[name]???[line]「Okarin? Earth to Okarin!」[%p]
[name]???[line]「You talking to someone?」[%p]
I nod and put my phone back to my ear.[%p]
Still no sound from the other side.[%p]
My contact is wise to maintain silence. The whole area could be bugged.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「...No, I was just talking to someone. Everything's fine. I'm about to infiltrate the assembly hall.」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「Yeah, Doctor Nakabachi got the jump on us, but I'll make sure he tells us everything.」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「What!? [color index="820000"]The Organization[color index="800000"] is already on the move!?」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「I see... so that's the choice of Steins Gate. El Psy Kongroo.」[%p]
Steins Gate.[%p]
Some know it as Fate; to others, it is the Will of God.[%p]
You could count on one hand the people in this world aware of its true nature.[%p]
In any case, we should begin the infiltration.[%p]
I advance towards Radi‐Kan, which is just across the street from the train station.[%p]
Of course, this is enemy territory. I can't just stride through the front door like an average person.[%p]
I bypass the elevators and escalators and head to the 8th floor by the stairwell.[%p]
At long last, I make it to the 8th floor. Honestly, I didn't think it would be so brutal.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]「Who was that on the phone?」[%p]
The girl – Shiina Mayuri – immediately resumes our conversation. She followed me all the way up here, and she isn't even short of breath.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「If I told you, I'd have to kill you.」[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]「Oh, wow. Thanks, Okarin!」[%p]
Mayuri is 16 – two years younger than me –[%p]
So she's more like a little sister than a typical childhood friend.[%p]
I've been looking out for her as long as I can remember.[%p]
I used to hope that Mayuri might become the key to Steins Gate, but now I've reconsidered.[%p]
I don't want that terrible fate for her. She should live a normal life.[%p]
That is my present wish.[%p]
Once inside, we're greeted by a sign reading 「Doctor Nakabachi's Time Machine Press Conference.」[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]「Okarin! Okarin!」[%p]
Mayuri insists on calling me Okarin, but it's neither my real name nor my codename. It's just one of those annoying nicknames people use.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「How many times do I have to tell you? Don't call me Okarin.」[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]「Huh? But I've always called you that.」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「That was then! I have since become Hououin Kyouma, the insane mad scientist hunted by secret organizations the world over. Muhahaha!」[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]「But that's too hard to remember.」[%p]
In any case, Hououin Kyouma is my [color index="820000"]true name[color index="800000"].[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]「And besides, it doesn't even sound like Okabe Rintaro. You're weird, ehehe!」[%p]
Okabe Rintaro may be my real name, but I have rejected it, for it is stupid.[%p]
And so I also hate the derivative 「Okarin.」[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]「So, Okarin, can I ask you something?」[%p]
In one ear and out the other.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]「What are we doing here?」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「Wait. You followed me here without knowing why?」[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]「Yup.」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「We're here for Doctor Nakabachi's press conference.」[%p]
We're standing in the assembly hall on the 8th floor of Radi‐Kan. It is here that the conference will be held.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]「Press conference? But where are the reporters?」[%p]
Mayuri's right.[%p]
Considering Nakabachi's notoriety and the topic at hand, I was expecting a larger audience.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「Could this be the Organization working its twisted influence?」[%p]
I thought that Nakabachi was like me, a scientist fighting to overthrow the Organization.[%p]
But this press conference suggests other motives at work.[%p]
Our enemies won't miss this chance.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「I'd prefer not to get wrapped up in his mess.」[%p]
Nevertheless, I'm interested in what he has to say.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]「You wrapped something? Is it his birthday too? Ehehe!」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「Keep your guard up, Mayuri. I suspect this won't be a normal confer–」[%p]
I didn't even finish my sentence![%p]
Are we under attack!? Are they trying to fry our brains with [color index="820000"]electromagnetic waves[color index="800000"]!?[%p]
We're definitely under attack.[%p]
It's coming from above us.[%p]
But we're on the top floor.[%p]
All that's above is the roof.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]「An earthquake? Is it magnitude 2? What does magnitude mean again?」[%p]
No time to deal with Mayuri's confusion. Something's not right about this.[%p]
Feeling uneasy, I bolt out of the conference hall.[%p]
I run up the stairs to the roof, ignoring the 「no trespassing」 signs in my way.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「What the...」[%p]
A strange machine is sitting in the middle of the roof.[%p]
It's huge, maybe three meters tall.[%p]
And looks kind of like a satellite.[%p]
Who put it here?[%p]
Was it Doctor Nakabachi? Is this part of his presentation?[%p]
Impossible. Even if that were the case, how the hell would he get it up here?[%p]
This is the rooftop of an eight‐story building, for crying out loud![%p]
[name]Girl[line]「Please stay back, everybody!」[%p]
[name]Girl[line]「The press conference will proceed as scheduled!」[%p]
Is she trying to hide something?[%p]
Her response was unusually quick, almost like she's trying to keep me away from that device.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「I've got a nose for conspiracies, and this stinks of a coverup. Just what are they trying to hide?」[%p]
I didn't realize it in the heat of the moment, but the lock on the rooftop door was broken... Is this the result of a mere prank, or could it be the Organization at work?[%p]
Though the stench of conspiracy burns at my nostrils, I resignedly return to the 8th floor.[%p]
Mayuri is nowhere to be seen. She's not in the event hall either.[%p]
I find her on the 7th floor.[%p]
Several [color index="820000"]capsule toy[color index="800000"] machines are lined up near the 7th floor entrance.[%p]
She's gazing upon them with a wistful look.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「What are you doing?」[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]「Hmm?」[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]「Well... I really want an Upa.」[%p]
Mayuri points to a capsule machine reading 「RaiNet AccessBattlers: Upa Collection.」[%p]
Nowadays, it's hard to find anyone unfamiliar with 「[color index="820000"]RaiNet Kakeru[color index="800000"].」[%p]
RaiNet Kakeru is a popular anime series with its own card game spinoff, RaiNet AccessBattlers. They even hold international tournaments.[%p]
「Upa」 is the series' mascot character.[%p]
It resembles an elliptical egg with limbs sticking out, like some kind of deformed dog.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「Then by all means, go ahead.」[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]「But Mayushii's all out of 100‐yen coins.」[%p]
「Mayushii」 is what Mayuri calls herself sometimes.[%p]
According to her, it's supposed to have an ☆ at the end – Mayushii☆.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]「So, can I borrow 100 yen? Please?」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「Do you think it's that easy, Mayuri? You'll get no money from me. Instead, I'll show you just how harsh life really is.」[%p]
I pull out a 100‐yen coin and drop it into the machine's coin slot.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]「Ah, ahh...」[%p]
I open the capsule and take out the contents.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]「It's an Upa! And it's metal! A Metal Upa!」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「Is it rare?」[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]「Super rare!」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「...」[%p]
Mayuri's eyes are sparkling. Does she really want it that badly?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「Hmph. I give this creature of metal to you, Mayuri.」[%p]
Honestly, I don't want it.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]「Really!? Are you sure, Okarin?」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「The name's Hououin Kyouma!」[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]「Ehehe! Thank you, Okarin.」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「...」[%p]
Is she doing it on purpose?[%p]
[name]Presenter[line]「Thank you all for coming to Doctor Nakabachi's Time Machine Press Conference.」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「Sounds like they're starting.」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「Let's go, Mayuri.」[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]「Mm... just a sec. I gotta write my name.」[%p]
She's preoccupied with the Metal Upa. I go on ahead.[%p]
[name]Presenter[line]「Without further ado, I am pleased to introduce the inventor, Doctor Nakabachi! Please welcome him with a big round of applause!」[%p]
[name]Nakabachi[line]「I am Doctor Nakabachi. Thank you all for coming.」[%p]
[name]Nakabachi[line]「Now then, ladies and gentlemen, allow me to begin with my theory of time travel, the greatest scientific breakthrough of the century.」[%p]
There are about 20 people now, including us.[%p]
But still no media presence to speak of.[%p]
So this is the extent of Dr.Nakabachi's fame.[%p]
No one believes that he invented a time machine.[%p]
I was interested in what he had to say, true, but my expectations were no higher than the rest of the onlookers.[%p]
And a good thing they weren't. As he proceeds to explain his time machine design, my curiosity quickly turns to disappointment, then anger.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「DOOOOOCTOOOOOOOORRR!!」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「Do you take us for fools!?」[%p]
[name]Nakabachi[line]「Who the hell are you?」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「Who the hell am I!? Someone who knows you for a fraud, that's who!」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「You stole your theory from [color index="820000"]John Titor[color index="800000"]! And you call yourself an inventor!?」[%p]
[name]Nakabachi[line]「S‐someone throw this man out!」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「You're the one we should throw out, Doctor! Have you no shame!? You have no right to call yourself an inventor!」[%p]
[name]Nakabachi[line]「Shut your mouth, you little pest!」[%p]
Just then, someone taps me on the shoulder from behind.[%p]
And suddenly grabs my arm! Is it a staffer!? Nay, an agent from the Organization!?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「Unhand me, you... huh?」[%p]
[name]???[line]「...」[%p]
It's a girl about my age.[%p]
Her face looks somehow familiar. Where have I seen her before?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「Ah...」[%p]
It's Makise Kurisu.[%p]
We haven't met, but I know her face.[%p]
A few days ago, my friend Daru showed me a magazine article titled 「Girl Genius Gives Lecture in Akihabara」.[%p]
The article was about a 17‐year‐old girl who had just graduated from an American university. Her thesis was even published in a major scientific journal.[%p]
What business could this genius girl have with me?[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]「Could you come with me for a moment?」[%p]
I don't believe that Makise Kurisu is a staff member at this venue.[%p]
Which means... no![%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「Y‐you're with the Organization!?」[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]「Huh?」[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]「Stop fooling around and come with me.」[%p]
I decided to shut up and follow suit.[%p]
My outburst has already attracted too much attention.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「...」[%p]
I let Makise Kurisu lead me out of the assembly hall.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「Try anything and people are sure to notice. What will your superiors say then?」[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]「What are you talking about?」[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]「I just need to ask you something.」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「What makes you think I'll answer? I know how the Organization operates.」[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]「What's with this 『Organization』 stuff?」[%p]
Instead of answering, I take out my phone and put it to my ear.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「It's me. I've been caught by an Organization agent. ...Yes, it's Makise Kurisu. She's a dangerous one. ...No, it's fine. I'll find a way to–」[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]「...」[%p]
What skill! I didn't have time to react.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「What are you doing!?」[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]「Huh? Your phone's off.」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「...」[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]「...Who were you talking to?」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「Y‐your techniques don't work on me, but I'll tell you anyway. That's no ordinary phone. It's designed to deactivate the moment it leaves my hand. Muhahaha!」[%p]
Such measures are necessary to maintain secrecy. I know things that could get me killed.[%p]
This statement was a mere gambit to get my phone back from Kurisu, but it somehow worked.[%p]
Whew, that was close.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]「...So you talk to yourself.」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「Guh!」[%p]
This is bad. Ordinary methods don't work on Makise Kurisu, the genius girl.[%p]
On the contrary, she's the one psyching me out![%p]
Damn. Looks like I'll have to make a tactical retreat.[%p]
If I can just find an opening![%p]
Just when I think I've found my moment, Kurisu's gaze meets mine, locking me in place.[%p]
Her powerful gaze blazes with strength of will.[%p]
Such fire. I can't look away.[%p]
Could someone with such pure eyes really be an Organization agent?[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]「What were you trying to tell me earlier?」[%p]
Earlier?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「What are you talking about?」[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]「About fifteen minutes ago. Before the conference started.」[%p]
Nonsense. This is the first time we've met.[%p]
I was with Mayuri and that Upa toy fifteen minutes ago.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]「You were trying to tell me something, right? You looked really upset.」[%p]
Is this a trap? It does seem like one of the Organization's dirty tricks.[%p]
But would this girl do something that underhanded?[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]「You looked like you were going to start crying any second.」[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]「Why? Have we met before?」[%p]
She seems sincere.[%p]
That makes her even more suspicious.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]「And how do you know my name?」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「My knowledge has no limits.」[%p]
I am a mad scientist, after all.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「Genius girl, our next meeting shall be as enemies!」[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]「Huh?」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「Farewell! Muhahaha!」[%p]
I ran down the stairs and quickly hid in the opposite stairway.[%p]
I hear Makise Kurisu's voice echoing after me, calling for me to stop. Like I'd listen to the enemy.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「Damn the Organization! They must be serious if they're sending in agents like her!」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「But I can't let them capture me yet.」[%p]
My mission was to attend the conference and evaluate Doctor Nakabachi's research. Now that I know he's a fraud, there's no real point in going back.[%p]
I guess I'll just go home.[%p]
But wait. Aren't I forgetting something important?[%p]
I was trying to prioritize that girl's safety, but I got careless.[%p]
I'll try calling her first. If she's alright, then I can just have her meet me here.[%p]
With that thought in mind, I take out my phone. I turn it on.[%p]
And it rings just as I do.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「Hm? An email?」[%p]
It's not just a regular email. There's a video attached.[%p]
And it's from an unknown address.[%p]
I open the video file with some trepidation.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「...Hm?」[%p]
Is this a prank? Or some sort of Makise Kurisu‐style attack? Maybe the noise is some sort of make‐people‐go‐crazy frequency.[%p]
...No, wait, I don't remember giving her my mail address, so I'm probably just thinking too hard.[%p]
I have more pressing matters to deal with anyway.[%p]
I stop the video and call Mayuri's phone from my address book.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「Dammit, Mayuri. Why won't you pick up?」[%p]
At this point, I've no choice but to go search for her.[%p]
But things will get messy if I bump heads with Makise Kurisu again.[%p]
Still, leaving without Mayuri isn't an option.[%p]
Call me overprotective, but she's like a little sister to me, and there's a very real danger that she might wander off somewhere the moment I let her out of my sight.[%p]
And by somewhere, really do mean anywhere.[%p]
Mayuri has always been like that. I never know if she'll be there when I turn to look.[%p]
...In a sense, that's why I became Hououin Kyouma.[%p]
With a sigh, I close my phone and begin my search.[%p]
Suddenly, I hear footsteps coming up the staircase.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]「Okarin! My Metal Upa ran away.」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「Ran away? What, it's alive? That's a little hard to believe.」[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]「I think I dropped it...」[%p]
I see, so she was looking for it.[%p]
Geez. To think I was actually worried about her...[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「Forget about it. You can always get another one.」[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]「No way. Metal Upas sell upwards of 10,000 yen online, you know?」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「Wait... what?」[%p]
That toy was worth that much!?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「Think, Mayuri! Where did you drop it!?」[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]「I don't know! That's why I'm looking. And even if we find it, you can't sell it, okay?」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「Muhahaha! That 10,000 yen will fund my research!」[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]「I said you can't sell it! It even has Mayushii's name on it.」[%p]
Thus begins our search for the Metal Upa.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]「Tutturu♪ Upa, Upa, come out, come out, wherever you are!」[%p]
Mayuri tries calling its name. I don't know if she truly expects a response.[%p]
By the way, 「tutturu♪」 is Mayuri's catchphrase.[%p]
It means... actually, I've never bothered to ask what it means.[%p]
Anyway, the Metal Upa is nowhere to be found.[%p]
This might mean that she didn't drop it at the 7th floor near the capsule machines, but somewhere on her way to the 8th floor.[%p]
There's also the possibility that it was pilfered by someone who knows just how much a Metal Upa is worth.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「What kind of man steals a helpless girl's toy? Is there nothing in his heart but the lust for money!?」[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]「Sounds like you, Okarin!」[%p]
Woah, wasn't expecting that from Mayuri.[%p]
[name]???[line]「AHHHHHHHHHHH!」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「!?」[%p]
Wh‐what was that?[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]「Was that a scream?」[%p]
I think so...[%p]
First the incident on the roof, and now this? What's going on here?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「Stay here, Mayuri!」[%p]
I follow the scream up the stairs and down a dark, empty hallway.[%p]
I'm pretty sure it came from around that corner.[%p]
And there, through a conspicuously open door, I see it.[%p]
There's something on the ground.[%p]
Motionless.[%p]
I recognized her clothing.[%p]
What was it?[%p]
...It can't be.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「Wha...」[%p]
Makise Kurisu...[%p]
The impertinent genius girl I just fought with 30 minutes ago.[%p]
...is now face down in a pool of bright red blood.[%p]
She's dead.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「No... but... why?」[%p]
I want to run. Run away.[%p]
I shouldn't have come.[%p]
This is wrong.[%p]
There's no other explanation.[%p]
Someone killed Makise Kurisu.[%p]
Who would do such a thing?[%p]
There's no one else here.[%p]
I need to get out of here, now.[%p]
I rush down to the 7th floor to grab Mayuri.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]「What happened, Okarin?」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「W‐we're leaving!」[%p]
I race down the stairs, trying to drive the image of Kurisu's dead body from my mind.[%p]
But I can't.[%p]
The redness of her blood is burned into my mind, more than the sight of the body itself.[%p]
Is this what it's like? When I realized that she was dead, I felt chilling terror and a surge of nausea.[%p]
But that was all I felt. Fear and disgust.[%p]
Shouldn't there be something more?[%p]
I guess I just didn't know her that well.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「Haah, haah...」[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]「Hey, what happened? You look really pale...」[%p]
She looks slow, but she's actually pretty fast on her feet.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「Someone... died.」[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]「Eh...」[%p]
I take several deep breaths.[%p]
The color of that blood still stains my brain.[%p]
But I've calmed down a bit.[%p]
Makise Kurisu is dead.[%p]
And I don't know who the killer is.[%p]
Sirens in the distance. I guess an ambulance will be here soon.[%p]
Then the police will arrive, and this area will become a crime scene.[%p]
But for now, the crowds milling through Akihabara have no idea what has happened.[%p]
Everyone is going about their business as usual, the neverending search for electronics, [color index="820000"]moe[color index="800000"], and porn.[%p]
I take my phone out of my pocket, perhaps out of reflex.[%p]
I'm not sure what I plan to do with it.[%p]
Oh, I know. My friend Daru. I'll tell him what happened just now, since he knows about Makise Kurisu.[%p]
Who could stay calm after witnessing something like that?[%p]
I have no idea who did it.[%p]
I don't even know for sure that it was a stabbing.[%p]
I just made the assumption, based on pool of blood on the floor and the fact that I didn't hear any gunshots.
On the other hand, I didn't write that she was dead, even though I'm pretty sure she was.[%p]
I can't exactly explain why I didn't.
If I had to say, I guess I felt like writing it down would set it in stone.[%p]
I finish typing and place my thumb over the send button.[%p]
And then...[%p]
With the lightest touch...[%p]
I press down.[%p]
Sending...[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「Wha!?」[%p]
What was that?[%p]
Wait! Look around![%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「They're gone...」[%p]
Summer break.[%p]
12:54PM.[%p]
Akihabara.[%p]
[color index="820000"]Chuo‐dori[color index="800000"], a three‐minute walk from the station.[%p]
Right there–[%p]
in an instant–[%p]
hundreds of pedestrians–[%p]
disappeared–[%p]
into thin air–[%p]
without a trace.[%p]
Is this a dream? Am I hallucinating?[%p]
I don't know.[%p]
But they're gone.[%p]
I saw them vanish with my own two eyes.[%p]
I stood there, alone, in the completely empty Akihabara, speechless and petrified.[%p]
I look around, but no one is there. Not even Mayuri.[%p]
I start to run through the uncannily empty streets of Akihabara.[%p]
I don't see anyone.[%p]
Not so much as a sign of life.[%p]
I have absolutely no idea what's going on.[%p]
My mind racing, I feel a strange presence above me, then look up.[%p]
And there, at the top of Radi‐Kan...[%p]
Sticking out from the 8th floor, where I'd just been...[%p]
Is a crashed satellite.[%p]
