I return to the lab to see a large, fearsome man standing out front.[%p]
He's the workshop's manager, actually the owner of this whole building, Tennouji Yuugo.[%p]
I call him Mister Braun.[%p]
It's a fitting name for someone who loves Braun tubes.[%p]
No sooner had he caught my attention than an unfamiliar woman jumped out from the Braun Tube Workshop.[%p]
[name]???[line]「Wazzaaap!」
[name]Rintaro[line]「...」[%p]
[name]???[line]「Um...?」[%p]
Who is this!? What sort of woman greets people like that?![%p]
[name]Amane[line]「Amane Suzuha.」[%p]
And after that nightmare of a greeting, she just introduces herself!? Such bold behavior! Could she be an Organization spy!?[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]「Oh, so you're the kid who wants the job interview.」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「A job interview!? This young woman!?」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「You want to work at the dull, dirty, depressing, debt‐ridden Braun Tube Workshop with this filthy old manager?」[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]「You want an extra thousand yen added to your rent?」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「...My words are but the truth. Though I suppose it's not my place to get involved.」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「Anyway, I had no idea the Braun Tube Workshop was hiring. You always look so... free. I didn't know you needed the help.」[%p]
[name]Amane[line]「Actually, I'm the one who begged for the job.」[%p]
[name]Amane[line]「The boss refused at first, but I wouldn't take no for an answer.」[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]「Age?」[%p]
[name]Amane[line]「18.」[%p]
Same as me.[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]「Why do you want to work here?」[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]「Because I love CRTs.」[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]「Hired! You start tomorrow!」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「Wait, what? Is this some sort of joke? Are we on camera!?」[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]「Thanks, boss.」[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]「Um, who are you?」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「You... dare ask my name? Banish the thought from your head, girl. To learn it would place your life in jeopardy.」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「Countless women have learned my name only to find themselves targets of the Organization. Sarah in America, Claudia in Italy, Simone in France... I won't put anyone else in danger.」[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]「Hey, stop pulling things outta yer ass.」[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]「This idiot rents the second floor. Name's Okabe Rintaro.」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「My name is not Okabe. It's Hououin–」[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]「Quit it, or I raise your rent.」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「...I'm Okabe Rintaro.」[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]「I don't know anything about this Organization that's after you.」[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]「But if you're ever in trouble, Okabe Rintaro, let me know. I can help with stuff like that.」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「...Huh?」[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]「...?」[%p]
Stuff... like what?[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]「If necessary, I can hurt them so bad they'll never bother you again.」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「Mister Braun, I don't think you should hire her.」[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]「Yeah. She might be a wild one. I'll fire her if she causes any trouble. Anyway, ignore that Organization nonsense. It's all in Okabe's head.」[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]「It is?」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「You just keep thinking that.」[%p]
[name]Suzuha[line]「So that's the current trend. Thanks for the tip!」[%p]
But some day, the world will kneel before me. Muhahaha!
After I make it back to the lab, I lug the broken TV down to the Braun Tube Workshop for repairs.[%p]
The sign on the door says 「closed,」 but I know from past experience not to take it at face value. Sure enough, I see Mister Braun in his workshop, relaxing with a cup of tea.[%p]
[name]???[line]「Yo! What's up, Okabe?」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「What's up? That TV you gave me broke, that's what.」[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]「I bet you were treating it rough, weren't ya?」[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]「Love. You gotta' treat 'em with love!」[%p]
A muscle‐bound bald guy talking about love...[%p]
It sends shivers down my spine.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「I'll need repairs post‐haste.」[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]「Man, why do you always talk like that?」[%p]
I see no sign of Suzuha Amane, the woman from earlier, inside the shop.[%p]
What I do see are CRT screens everywhere.[%p]
The haphazard layout makes them seem like junk, but they're all functional, according to Mister Braun.[%p]
He's got a full range of both old and new. Some of them are probably older than me. There are even some flat screen and HD CRTs that came out just before LCDs took the market.[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]「Oh, there's probably just a loose solder on the board. I can fix it.」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「Really? Well, then by all means.」[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]「Hold on. I'll get you an estimate.」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「What!? You're charging me!?」[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]「What'd you think? This ain't some charity!」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「You're the one who gave us the TV!」[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]「Yeah, so what? Never said I'd service it for free.」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「Curse you... you have some gall to say that after foisting a half‐broken piece of junk onto us!」[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]「Oh, shut up. If you don't want it, I can take it back. Though I'll have to charge ya for its safe disposal.」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「Extortion! You dare cheat the man who very well may change the future of mankind!?」[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]「Hah? Who's that, now?」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「Me, of course. Who else?」[%p]
[name]Tennouji[line]「Brush your teeth and go to sleep, kid. You've got some nerve to be back‐talking when I'm lettin' you rent the second floor for next to nothing.」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「Hmph. You shall have your money, Mister Braun.」[%p]
I manage to talk him into giving us a temporary replacement TV in exchange for the repair fee, and carry it back up to the lab.[%p]
It's from Mayuri.[%p]
Should I reply?[%p]
I don't have time for this right now.[%p]
There. That should do it.[%p]
