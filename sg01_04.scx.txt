In any case, there's nothing we can do about it now. It's time for Daru and I to head to [color index="820000"]Daibiru[color index="800000"].[%p]
There's going to be a seminar at [color index="820000"]ATF[color index="800000"], and we have to be there.
Tokyo Denki University, where Daru and I go to school, collaborates with ATF to set up satellite classes.[%p]
Summer credits, basically.[%p]
We have to attend the seminar and write a report.[%p]
Come to think of it, what's today's seminar about, again?
I looked it up before the summer holiday began. I should have written it down.[%p]
[name]Female Reporter[line]「Behind me is the large, unidentified object that crashed into a building near Akihabara Station!」[%p]
[name]Female Reporter[line]「The building is under police barricade. No one is allowed to approach, but from a distance, the object appears to be some kind of satellite!」[%p]
It's from Mayuri.[%p]
Responding to every last aspect of a message is a waste of time. I should just pick one topic to respond to. Or maybe I won't reply at all.[%p]
I don't have time for this right now.[%p]
There. That should do it.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]「Man, feel that AC! I'm alive!」[%p]
Unlike the lab, Daibiru has air conditioning, making it an oasis for poorer students like us.[%p]
Yet another reason for our diligent participation in the seminar.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「About the PhoneWave (name subject to change). I might have found our answer.」[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]「You know, that 『(name subject to change)』 thing is really annoying.」[%p]
I won't give in that easily. Even if no other lab members use 『(name subject to change)』, I will carry on until the day we decide its true name.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「Now's not the time.」[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]「So, what's your latest ridiculous theory?」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「What do you mean, ridiculous? My genius brain considers [color index="850000"]every[color index="800000"] possibility, even those a lesser mind would say break the laws of nature. Don't you dare call that ridiculous.」[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]「So basically, you're just pulling stuff outta your ass. You can't call that science.」[%p]
Tch, stop interrupting me. At this rate, I'll never get to my point.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「Daru. I have a hunch that the PhoneWave (name subject to change) may be the key to opening Steins Gate. How's that?」[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]「Steins what? You lost me back at 『ridiculous』, man.」[%p]
Let me share my revelations about the PhoneWave (name subject to change), damn you![%p]
My brilliant ideas will clearly find no purchase with Daru. Time to change the topic.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「So you're telling me you have no interest in checking out Radi‐Kan?」[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]「I won't get to see anything anyway. Besides, most of the info's out on the net already. There's more than 100 threads on @channel. It's nuts, dude.」[%p]
But when I ask him if there's any information about Makise Kurisu on @channel–[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]「That again?」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「What do you mean, 『again』?」[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]「I mean, you sent me that email like a week ago, right?」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「I sent you an email?」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「Don't be ridiculous! I saw her dead just three hours ago!」[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]「You know, that message was kinda weird. It was dated a week after I got it, which means it came from the future.」[%p]
He's right. The email was sent from my phone.[%p]
It was split into three mails.[%p]
「Someone stab」[%p]
「bed Makise K」[%p]
「urisu. Don't」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「This is the email I sent you three hours ago.」[%p]
A chime signals our arrival on the 5th floor.[%p]
The elevator doors open slowly.
As we step out of the elevator–[%p]
I see a girl.[%p]
And I recognize her.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「You... you...!」[%p]
Impossible.[%p]
Chills run down my spine.[%p]
I can't move a finger.[%p]
I stare at her face in disbelief.[%p]
Makise Kurisu![%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]「Is there something wrong?」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「Y‐you...」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「You should be dead! Why are you here!?」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「And you're even...」[%p]
There isn't a single bloodstain on her clothes, and they're the same ones she was wearing when I found her.[%p]
Only a serious wound could have produced that much blood.[%p]
Yet as far as I can tell, she's completely uninjured.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「Not a scratch...」[%p]
I realize that I'm gasping in disbelief.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]「What's wrong with you?」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「You're okay? But that's impossible! Someone stabbed you! I saw you lying in a pool of blood!」[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]「Hey! Could you not talk about me like that? I'm perfectly fine.」[%p]
Is she an illusion!? No, an evil spirit!? Am I haunted!?[%p]
I don't believe in such unscientific drivel! I am a mad scientist![%p]
Feels silky. Quite the cuticles.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「Substance. She has substance. Of course she's not a ghost. How silly of me.」[%p]
Her skin's so soft. So alive. Dead bodies don't feel like this. Not that I've ever touched one.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]「...」[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]「O‐Okarin, I don't think that's a good idea...」[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]「...Hey.」[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]「Are you trying to get yourself arrested?」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「I just want to know the truth.」[%p]
That's right, she was stabbed! Maybe she's just hiding her wounds.[%p]
This requires further investigation.[%p]
I grab the hem of her jacket–[%p]
Pull it aside and take a good look at her chest.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]「What truth, you perv!? You stupid!? Wanna die!?」[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]「[color index="820000"]Louise‐chan[color index="800000"]'s famous line for the win!」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「I know what I saw!」[%p]
Earlier this afternoon, after Doctor Nakabachi's presentation, someone killed Makise Kurisu and left her in a pool of blood.[%p]
I carefully explain everything that I saw.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]「Wait. Doctor Nakabachi?」[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]「What are you talking about, Okarin? Doctor Nakabachi's presentation was canceled.」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「Canceled!?」[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]「Yeah. Because of the satellite crash.」[%p]
Something's wrong. Our stories aren't matching.[%p]
It's the same thing that happened right after I saw the mass disappearance. Mayuri's story didn't match mine.[%p]
I need to know.[%p]
Am I caught in some sinister plot?[%p]
Is this another Organization conspiracy?[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]「Excuse me, um...」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「My name... is Hououin Kyouma!」[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]「Really, man? You're hopeless...」[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]「Okay, Hououin‐[color index="820000"]san[color index="800000"]. I'd like to hear your story in more detail.」[%p]
Looks like she finally understands I'm not lying.[%p]
But I still don't understand why my memories don't match everyone else's. I doubt that I can give her a good explanation.[%p]
[name]Professor[line]「Makise‐san? It's almost time.」[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]「Huh? Oh, right. Thank you.」[%p]
Kurisu glances at me one more time, then sighs and heads towards the small conference room.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]「We should go too.」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「Go where?」[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]「To hear the lecture, duh?」[%p]
Ahh, that.[%p]
Did she come to attend the lecture too? Strange.[%p]
Why would the girl genius, Makise Kurisu, need to attend a lecture like this?[%p]
