I had to pull Daru away from Faris so we could return to the lab. We arrive to find it hotter than a sauna in hell.[%p]
I quickly open the windows, letting a small breeze blow in. It won't be enough.[%p]
It's from Faris.[%p]
Should I reply?[%p]
I don't have time for this right now.[%p]
There. That should do it.[%p]
I really wish we had an air conditioner.[%p]
I turn on the computer.[%p]
This is our PC for communal use among lab members. It still uses an old CRT monitor, so it looks ancient.[%p]
I wonder if the 「new」 Titor is still posting.[%p]
