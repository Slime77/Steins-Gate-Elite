It's from Lukako.[%p]
Should I reply?[%p]
I don't have time for this right now.[%p]
There. That should do it.[%p]
MayQueen+Nyan² is only a three minute walk from the lab.[%p]
Coming from Kuramaebashi‐dori, take a left at Tsumakoisaka Crossing and you'll find it.[%p]
Because I'd planned to meet with Daru in the afternoon, I decided to kill some time at the university before heading over.[%p]
It's usually busy in Akiba during summer break, but now it's even busier because of the Radi‐Kan incident.[%p]
So many people...[%p]
Living in Akiba, you get used to crowds and big events, but a gathering of this size is unusual.[%p]
But I still don't understand what I saw yesterday.[%p]
I've half accepted that the mass disappearance was just my imagination.[%p]
Maybe I've become unable to distinguish reality from fantasy, like the media likes to say about teenagers these days.[%p]
With that thought in mind, I return my gaze to the street.
[name]Rintaro[line]「...!?」[%p]
Her phone was clearly pointed at me.[%p]
I tried to cover my face, but not quickly enough.[%p]
[name]???[line]「...」[%p]
The Organization is after me, so I can't risk that photo getting out.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「Wait wait wait!」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「Hey, you with the phone camera! Wait! Please, wait!」[%p]
[name]Lady[line]「...?」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「Hey! No pictures! Are you with the Organization!?」[%p]
[name]Voyeur Lady[line]「...」[%p]
She completely ignores my objection.[%p]
And then she goes back to looking at her phone.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「Answer my question. Are you with the Organization?」[%p]
If she is, then I may have to take suitable measures.[%p]
A man like me is not to be underestimated.[%p]
[name]Possible Organization Spy[line]「...」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「Y‐you're not?」[%p]
[name]Probably Not Organization Spy[line]「...」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「Even so, I can't let you keep that picture. The Organization will stop at nothing to find my whereabouts, and they'll kill anyone who gets in their way!」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「I need you to delete that picture immediately.」[%p]
[name]Lady Ignoring Me[line]「...」[%p]
Is she even listening?[%p]
[name]Lady Ignoring Me[line]「...Sorry.」[%p]
[name]Lady Who Apologized out of Nowhere[line]「If I... upset you.」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「Before you apologize, I need you to delete that photo.」[%p]
[name]Lady Ignoring Me[line]「I was shooting... the scenery.」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「The scenery? You're a tourist?」[%p]
[name]Lady Ignoring Me and Apparently Sightseeing in Akihabara[line]「...It's proof. Of where I was today.」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「You're a strange lady...」
[name]Strange Lady Apparently Sightseeing in Akihabara[line]「Kiryu... Moeka.」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「Hm?」[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]「My name.」[%p]
I guess she's introducing herself.[%p]
That wasn't exactly what I was hoping for.[%p]
It's nice and all, but I just want her to delete that photo.[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]「I have a question for you... may I?」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「First, the photo–」[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]「There's an urban legend... in Akihabara.」[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]「...Have you heard of it?」[%p]
An urban legend?[%p]
What is she talking about?[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]「The phantom... retro PC.」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「Retro PC?」[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]「They say there's one... in Akihabara.」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「A retro PC... you mean like a [color index="820000"]98[color index="800000"]?」[%p]
That's the first model that comes to mind.[%p]
But are 98s really that hard to find?[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]「...No. This.」[%p]
It looks kind of familiar.[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]「An IBN 5100.」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「That's the computer John Titor tried to get.」[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]「You've seen one?」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「No. I've only heard the name.」[%p]
Coincidence?[%p]
No...[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「This could be the choice of Steins Gate.」[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]「Know anyone... who might know?」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「Daru probably knows more about it.」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「He's my Favorite Right Arm. A super hacka capable of breaking into even [color index="820000"]MI6's[color index="800000"] mainframe.」[%p]
The MI6 part is a slight exaggeration.[%p]
If that ever did happen, men in black would break down our door and take us away.[%p]
But the super hacka part is true.[%p]
The depth of his computer knowledge is uncanny.[%p]
Speaking of Daru, I'm supposed to meet him at MayQueen+Nyan². I don't have time to stand and chat with some crazy lady I don't know.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「Well, I'm off. Lady, [color index="820000"]media scrum[color index="800000"] in moderation.」[%p]
I try to make a smooth exit, one‐liner and everything, but she grabs my sleeve before I can disappear into the crowd.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「What are you doing!?」[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]「Your email... please.」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「...What are you after?」[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]「The super hacka...」[%p]
I guess she wants to hear Daru's story.[%p]
It's my fault for mentioning him.[%p]
Well, I'm meeting up with Daru, so why don't I just take her along?[%p]
...No, wait a second.[%p]
This could be a devious trap.[%p]
Maybe she's really a spy sent to kidnap Daru.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「I refuse! I'll never give up Daru!」[%p]
Unperturbed, she shows me her phone again.[%p]
On the screen is the picture of me that she took.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「Gehhh! You still haven't deleted it?」[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]「Tell me... and I'll delete it.」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「You dare blackmail me? Who do you work for?」[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]「I...」[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]「Work part‐time... at Arc Rewrite.」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「What's that?」[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]「An editorial company... here in Akihabara.」[%p]
One of those companies that writes articles for magazines?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「Wait! You plan on publishing my picture without permission, don't you!?」[%p]
「The mad scientist of Akiba, unveiled!」 I can see the headlines now.[%p]
That's all the Organization will need to turn Akiba into a sea of blood.[%p]
No. I must avoid that gruesome outcome at all costs.[%p]
I have no choice.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「Very well. I accept your terms.」[%p]
At any rate, as long as she has that photo, I have no way of knowing how it might be used.[%p]
I pull up my email address and show it to her.[%p]
The woman is typing with terrifying speed. Faster than my fingers could ever dream of.[%p]
It seems she has finished entering my email address. It can't have taken longer than five seconds.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「Of course... this woman is an [color index="820000"]esper[color index="800000"].」[%p]
I dub her power... Shining Finger! Her magical thumb types cursed emails at 255 characters per minute. Whoever receives one dies.[%p]
She can type 255 cursed words per minute. Any poor soul that recieves one of her emails shall die.[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]「...Name?」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「Hououin Kyouma, Mad Scientist.」[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]「How... is it spelled?」[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]「Like this?」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「What the hell is this!? Are you mocking me!?」[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]「...」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「Just hand me your phone! I'll enter it!」[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]「...!」
But the woman swiftly avoids me, keeping her phone out of my reach.[%p]
It feels as if she's rejecting my entire personhood.[%p]
Anyway, she's obviously not going to hand her phone over, so I ask for her address instead. I'll send her a blank mail.[%p]
She told me her name a few minutes ago, but I forgot it already, so I enter her as 「Shining Finger.」[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]「...」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「...」[%p]
I don't need to type anything.[%p]
It's just to give her my name.[%p]
I already put her in my contacts. Just send a blank email to Shining Finger.[%p]
And send.[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]「...」[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]「Okabe... Rintaro?」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「What!? How do you know that name!?」[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]「From the blank email...」[%p]
Damn, my email is still linked to my real name.[%p]
I must change it at once![%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「That's just my alias. I'll send another one with my true–」[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]「No... this is fine.」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「Nonsense! I am not Okabe Rintaro, but Hououin Kyou–」[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]「...」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「Did you delete the picture?」[%p]
She nods slightly... I think.[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]「I'll email you... later.」[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]「So ask... okay?」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「About what?」[%p]
[name]Moeka[line]「...The urban legend.」[%p]
Oh, that.[%p]
I almost forgot.[%p]
With that, Shining Finger wanders off.[%p]
