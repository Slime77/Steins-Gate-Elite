Once it got dark, I started looking for more information on the mass disappearance phenomenon and Makise Kurisu's stabbing.[%p]
I search through a number of news sites, only to turn up nothing.[%p]
So were those hallucinations after all?[%p]
But while I was looking at @channel, I noticed that a thread was posted by a 「John Titor.」[%p]
Wait. John Titor is back?[%p]
John Titor appeared on an American BBS 10 years ago, claiming to be a time traveler.[%p]
He claimed to have traveled from the year 2036 in order to obtain an old computer, the [color index="820000"]IBN[color index="800000"] 5100. His claims started quite a storm among the BBS denizens.[%p]
Titor also made several accurate – if fragmentary – predictions of future events.[%p]
The start of the Iraq War, and the spread of [color index="820000"]Creutzfeldt‐Jakob disease[color index="800000"], for example.[%p]
To prove he was from the future, he explained the principles behind his time machine and provided pictures of its operation manual.[%p]
But after about four months, he disappeared without ever revealing his identity.[%p]
At one point, his predictions gained popularity even in Japan.[%p]
Yes, he certainly did get some things right.[%p]
But on the other hand, he missed several others. Some of his posts contradicted each other, too. That's why, to this day, most people doubt his authenticity as a time traveler.[%p]
So after ten years of silence, that same John Titor is now on a Japanese BBS?[%p]
Ridiculous. It's obviously a [color index="820000"]troll[color index="800000"].[%p]
First of all, John Titor is American. Yet now, he's posting on @channel in Japanese.[%p]
I read through the entire thread, but archives were already popping up.[%p]
Of course, there have been sites dedicated to John Titor for years now.[%p]
This new John Titor is clearly an impostor.[%p]
In fact, impostor is too kind a word. This is probably all copypasta.[%p]
There are many Titor fanatics on @channel.[%p]
He's not exactly a household name in Japan, but I doubt anyone would fall for this level of trolling.[%p]
As I continue to read, however, I find the response the opposite of what I expected.[%p]
Everyone is accepting this 「time traveler」 as if this were his first appearance.[%p]
Nobody has even mentioned his appearance 10 years ago.[%p]
Finding this strange, I try posting a retort, but everyone ignores me.[%p]
What the hell?[%p]
You can figure this out if you do a little research, people![%p]
There's the original John Titor thread archive in English, for one thing.[%p]
Plenty of blogs about Titor in Japanese, too.[%p]
I enter John Titor's name into a search engine.[%p]
12 matches.[%p]
Wait... only 12?[%p]
Moreover, all 12 are about the current Titor's postings on @channel.[%p]
I can't find a single trace of the Titor from 10 years ago.[%p]
I try searching 「john titor.」[%p]
Bizarre. This just can't be.[%p]
I searched for information on Titor a few years ago. Back then, I got tens of thousands of hits.[%p]
Is this search engine filtered?[%p]
I try searching on another site just to make sure, but it gives the same result.[%p]
What is this madness?[%p]
It feels like I've stumbled onto another plane of reality.[%p]
Could this be another Organization conspiracy?[%p]
I'm starting to get a bad feeling about this.[%p]
These past two days, I've been surrounded by nothing but chaos and confusion.[%p]
Hold on. I just remembered...[%p]
I know I purchased a book about Titor a few years ago![%p]
I scour the bookshelf for it, but it's nowhere to be found. It's supposed to be right here![%p]
Impossible. How could this be!?[%p]
I'll call Daru.[%p]
He'll know about Titor for sure.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]「Yeah?」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「It's me. Report.」[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]「...Okarin, can you drop the act when you're on the phone at least?」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「Are you aware that John Titor has returned?」[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]「I have no idea what you're talking about.」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「I have a sensitive matter to discuss.」[%p]
I quickly made plans to meet with him at MayQueen+Nyan² tomorrow afternoon, and hung up the phone.
