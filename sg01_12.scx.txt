Woah, I shouldn't waste all day on @channel.[%p]
We have more important things to deal with.[%p]
Namely, the PhoneWave (name subject to change). We haven't experimented with it since yesterday.[%p]
It's high time I figure out what's going on with that thing.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「Hey, Daru. What's with the [color index="820000"]X68000[color index="800000"]?」[%p]
I mean, it's a 20‐year‐old machine with specs lower than my cellphone.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]「It's cool. Duh.」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「So, it's like the reason why some protagonists are [color index="820000"]odd‐eyed[color index="800000"] even though they're Japanese?」[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]「Not getting you, bro.」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「It's cool.」[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]「If it's cool, then it's cool.」[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]「Anyway, there wasn't much of an option. This was the only PC we weren't using.」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「What about your new one?」[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]「No way. We don't know what could happen when it's connected to your crazy machine. It could kill the performance.」[%p]
Selfish bastard.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]「Anyway, did you do any research on the gelification?」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「Yeah, at the university this morning.」[%p]
Why would a banana gelify? What kind of science are we dealing with here?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「I examined a sample under a microscope and found it was shredded at the molecular level.」[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]「Shredded?」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「It's not a mere [color index="820000"]phase transition[color index="800000"]. The banana became something entirely different.」[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]「Could it have rotted? ...Nah. There's no way 2 minutes in the microwave could do that.」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「Then I remembered about [color index="820000"]fractal structures[color index="800000"].」[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]「The [color index="820000"]Menger sponge[color index="800000"] thing?」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「Yeah. It looked like something drilled holes into the banana. An infinite number of holes in a fractal pattern, right down to the nano level.」[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]「Whoa. What could do something like that?」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「I have one hypothesis...」[%p]
Daru gulps, waiting for me to continue.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「It's the result of the microwave's electromagnetic waves.」[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]「W‐what does that mean?」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「If my guess is correct, then our PhoneWave (name subject to change) has the potential to become a weapon of unprecedented destructive power, one that could change the face of war as we know it. Hehehe.」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「It's me. We're proceeding to stage two of the plan. Soon they will learn... that Judgment Day is near.」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「All shall be as Steins Gate wills. Resistance is futile. El Psy Kongroo.」[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]「Quit talking to your imaginary friend. I'm done with the wiring.」[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]「Well? What's next?」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「We have bananas.」[%p]
Just before I left MayQueen+Nyan², Mayuri asked me to buy some bananas.[%p]
With her money.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]「You know Mayu‐shi's gonna cry if you use them all, right? Wasn't it her money?」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「She donated that money to our research efforts.」[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]「You don't have to use the whole thing. One is enough. One.」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「We'll never reshape the fabric of society as long as money dictates the limits of our science.」[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]「You're the only one who wants to reshape society, Okarin.」[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]「C'mon, start the timer already.」[%p]
Complete.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「Two minutes sure is long...」[%p]
It's from Faris. There's no way I can combat this...[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]「You know, if the microwave's emissions are doing it, then shouldn't our cells be getting gelified too?」[%p]
While still looking bored, Daru finally gets into the discussion at hand.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「Well, have you ever nuked yourself inside the PhoneWave (name subject to change)?」[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]「I can't even fit in there.」[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]「Anyway, what's your source on the electromagnetic waves?」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「If you must know... it's my mad scientist's intuition.」[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]「Oh, so no facts.」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「Edison once said, 『Without one percent inspiration, ninety‐nine percent of perspiration is wasted. So, inventors of the world... be inspired!』 End quote.」[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]「Wasn't it 『Genius is one percent inspiration, ninety‐nine percent perspiration』?」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「Sorry to disappoint, but in recent years it's become common knowledge that [color index="850000"]that[color index="800000"] is a misquote.」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「Muhahaha!」[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]「Edison said that? 『Be inspired!』...?」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「Yes. 『Be inspired!』 he said.」[%p]
I don't know if that was exactly what he said, but I'm sure it was something along those lines.[%p]
At least, that's what the wiki said.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「Therefore, as a genius mad scientist, I am always insp–」[%p]
The PhoneWave (name subject to change) rings.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「This is just going to gelify the banana like usual, isn't it? We need a new experiment.」[%p]
Daru opens the PhoneWave (name subject to change)'s door and peeks inside.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]「What? What!?」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「What are you doing?」[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]「Well... uh... it's...」[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]「...gone.」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「Gone? What's gone?」[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]「The banana.」[%p]
What is he talking about?[%p]
I push Daru aside and look into the PhoneWave (name subject to change).[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「...It's gone.」[%p]
...It was gone.[%p]
There's nothing inside.[%p]
The banana has vanished without a trace.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「...」[%p]
I speak into the silence on the other side of the phone.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「It's me. Slight problem. We may have awakened something... terrible.」[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]「Wh‐what do you mean something terrible!?」[%p]
I ignore Daru's panicked cry.[%p]
I'm surprised too. My heart's pounding. But I try to appear calm.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「I'm invoking Emergency Order 666. Activate the Coldheart Protocol!」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「What!? What do you mean we need congressional approval!? There's no time, you fool! Tokyo will be blasted to atoms!」[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]「Y‐you should be an actor.」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「Where the hell did it go!?」[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]「How should I know!?」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「Where did you go? Banaana! BANAAANA!」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「W‐wait... I think I get it now! It's not an electromagnetic weapon, it's a teleportation device!」[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]「Wh‐what!?」[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]「Wait, that's absurd.」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「How else could it have vanished? The microwave was closed!」[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]「Um, maybe we should just calm down.」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「Y‐yeah. You're right...」[%p]
Oh, I know. I'll eat one of the remaining bananas. That will calm me down.[%p]
And can't believe my eyes.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「What... the...!?」[%p]
Impossible![%p]
Not three minutes ago, Daru plucked a banana from the bunch and put it inside the PhoneWave (name subject to change).[%p]
...Or so we thought.[%p]
But now, there's no sign that a banana was ever plucked.[%p]
Instead, a single gelified banana has appeared among the regular bananas.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]「Oh shit! What the hell's going on?」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「Wait! How many bananas are in the lab right now!?」[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]「J‐just these, I think...」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「Is this gelbana attached to the same stem as the banana you just picked?」[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]「I dunno, man... I wasn't paying attention.」[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]「It doesn't look like it was ever plucked...」[%p]
That's right, the bunch is completely intact.[%p]
Aside from the gelification, it looks completely normal.[%p]
Not so much as a sign that the gelified banana was stuck onto the bunch after the fact.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「H‐hey, Daru... could this possibly be...」[%p]
The word I spoke impulsively a few seconds ago.[%p]
I hesitate to speak it again.[%p]
My head's full of question marks. I don't know how this happened. But if I were to explain it as I saw it...[%p]
The banana that was inside the PhoneWave (name subject to change) returned instantly to its bunch. In other words...[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「A teleporter... we've invented a teleporter!」[%p]
