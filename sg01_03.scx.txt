Step through the curtain dividing its center, and you'll enter the heart of the Future Gadget Laboratory: a top secret development room restricted only to lab members.[%p]
Personally, I'm not fond of this cheap curtain – I often dream of replacing it with an airlock – but our research budget is already scraping the bottom of the barrel.[%p]
Besides, what's important isn't money. It's ambition.[%p]
All of the windows here are weather stripped with packing tape, so it's dim.[%p]
And hot, almost like a sauna.[%p]
I've been wanting to buy an air conditioner for the lab, but there's no money for that. We're currently accepting donations.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「Daru. Is the plan progressing smoothly?」[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]「Uh, what plan?」[%p]
I sigh and turn his attention to the table in the middle of the room.[%p]
Sitting majestically on top of the table is a commercial‐grade [color index="820000"]microwave oven[color index="800000"]. It's significantly larger than newer home models.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「The plan, as in [color index="850000"]the plan[color index="800000"]. Obviously, I'm talking about perfecting Gadget No.8.」[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]「Oh, that. How was I supposed to know what you meant?」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「We've known each other for what, three years now?」[%p]
We went to high school together. And now, we're going to the same university. We share an inseparable bond, like prison cellmates. He's only been a lab member for two months, though.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]「We were in different classes junior year, and actually we didn't talk at all. So two years?」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「Details. The point is we've known each other a long time. I expect you to keep up with me here.」[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]「N O P E」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「...」[%p]
Man. All I wanted to do was have one of those cool cryptic conversations where we talk about 「plans」 and 「preparations」 and other important‐sounding stuff but no one knows what it means except us.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「So, are we any closer to figuring out what's wrong with Gadget No.8?」[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]「Not yet.」[%p]
So far, the Future Gadget Laboratory has completed a total of eight inventions.[%p]
As I explained to Alpacaman, the lab's primary goal is to develop weapons for the war against the Dark Dominion, led by the Organization, that rules the world from the shadows.[%p]
At present, we haven't completed any inventions of that sort. On the contrary. We haven't even figured out what we should make.[%p]
But along the way, we have managed to create some ingenious Future‐ish Gadgets as a byproduct of our research.[%p]
It is a fundamental truth of science that great inventions are often created by accident. In other words, [color index="820000"]serendipity[color index="800000"].[%p]
So far, they total 8 in number.[%p]
Gadget No.1, the [color index="820000"]Bit Particle Gun[color index="800000"].[%p]
Gadget No.2, the [color index="820000"]Bamboo Helicam[color index="800000"].[%p]
Gadget No.3, [color index="820000"]Could This Be Ora Ora!?[color index="800000"].[%p]
Gadget No.4, [color index="820000"]Moad Snake[color index="800000"].[%p]
Gadget No.5, [color index="820000"]『Once Again I've Made A Worthless Object』 by Goemon[color index="800000"].[%p]
Gadget No.6, the [color index="820000"]Cyalume Saber[color index="800000"].[%p]
Gadget No.7, [color index="820000"]Ghost in the Ball[color index="800000"].[%p]
Anyway, our current problem is Future Gadget No.8, the PhoneWave (name subject to change).[%p]
「PhoneWave」 is a pretty weak name, so I've added (name subject to change) to the end until we come up with something better. For the record, it was Mayuri's idea, not mine.[%p]
But I digress.[%p]
The PhoneWave (name subject to change) is, in short, a remote‐controlled microwave.[%p]
A few days ago, however, we discovered that the PhoneWave (name subject to change) has a second, unintended capability.[%p]
Our brave – or possibly just ditzy – Mayuri had made it her daily routine to heat some frozen fried chicken by remote control.[%p]
Long story short, she was defrosting her beloved 「Juicy Chicken Number One!」 as usual when the unexpected happened.[%p]
The chicken came out more frozen than when she'd put it in. The microwave [color index="850000"]refroze[color index="800000"] the chicken.[%p]
Bear in mind, the frozen chicken had almost thawed by the time she placed it in the PhoneWave (name subject to change).[%p]
But when she removed it, it was frozen solid.[%p]
Since then, Daru and I have been searching for the cause.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]「We tried copying what Mayu‐shi did, but we just can't reproduce the freezing phenomenon.」[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]「And when we tried to freeze a banana, it turned out really weird.」[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]「I just don't get it.」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「Mayuri! Mayuri! Bring forth the bananas!」[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]「Are you gonna turn them into gelbanas again?」[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]「That's been bugging me, Mayu‐shi. Can you stop calling them 『gelbanas』?」[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]「But gelbanas are gelbanas.」[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]「Why do you have to use the whole bunch? It's a waste of food.」[%p]
I take the bananas from Mayuri and stick the whole bunch into the PhoneWave (name subject to change).[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「Your stinginess could cost us the battle with the Organization!」[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]「That's fine with me. Mayushii always buys the bananas, and now Mayushii can't eat a single one.」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「Next time, we'll only do one banana.」[%p]
The PhoneWave (name subject to change) is simple to use.[%p]
It's a microwave with a phone taped on.[%p]
The number is already in my address book. I just need to call the PhoneWave.[%p]
I waste no time.[%p]
The call connects in an instant.[%p]
[name]Guidance[line]「Hello. This is the PhoneWave (name subject to change).」[%p]
This is the voice of Mayushii Guidance, the system Daru programmed to operate the phonewave.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]「Do you hear Mayushii's voice?」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「Be quiet. I'm trying to listen.」[%p]
[name]Guidance[line]「You can operate the timer from this menu.」[%p]
[name]Guidance[line]「After pushing the # button, please enter the heating time in seconds.」[%p]
[name]Guidance[line]「For example, press 『#60』 for one minute.」[%p]
[name]Guidance[line]「For two minutes, press 『#120』.」[%p]
Entering the command properly will cause the PhoneWave (name subject to change) to function like a normal microwave.[%p]
Instead, we're going to deliberately mess up and enter 「120#」.[%p]
That should do it.[%p]
This method was originally a simple mistake on Mayuri's part, but it somehow starts the freezing process.[%p]
The PhoneWave (name subject to change) comes to life.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]「Nice turntable, right? It's even spinning backwards.」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「Backwards!?」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「That might have serious implications! If we look at quantum critical behavior driven by [color index="820000"]Hund's rule[color index="800000"]–」[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]「Yeah! No.」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「...not Hund's Rule?」[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]「No.」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「...okay.」[%p]
The three of us wait and stare at the spinning bananas.[%p]
After 120 seconds pass, the microwave chimes.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]「Gelbanas are ready!」[%p]
After Mayuri discovered that the PhoneWave (name subject to change) had a freezing function, we attempted to freeze a bunch of bananas. This is what happened.[%p]
It just gets more confusing each time.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「Daru. You wouldn't mind [color index="850000"]eating[color index="800000"] one of these, would you? Of course you wouldn't. It's for science! Your sacrifice will forever be remembered!」[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]「...They look really nasty.」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「The taste doesn't matter. What matters is that you eat it! So come on, Daru, no need to be shy. Break a leg, or a stomach, and go for it!」[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]「No way.」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「...Fine. Mayuri! The honor shall be yours.」[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]「But gelbanas are all gloopy, droopy, soft, and squishy.」[%p]
Wait, she already tried one?[%p]
This girl's ditziness is truly on another level.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]「It had no flavor and wasn't tasty at all...」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「Gloopy, droopy, soft and squishy... Daru, what do you think?」[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]「Soft and squishy bananas, huh... Soft and squishy... banana...」[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]「Mayu‐shi, say 『your banana's all soft and squishy』 for me.」[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]「Your banana's all soft and–」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「Don't make her say that, you perv!」
