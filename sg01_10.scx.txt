[name]Maids[line]「Welcome back, Myaster!」[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]「It's Okarin!」[%p]
In this place, Mayuri is known as 「Mayushii NyanNyan.」[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]「Welcome back, Okarin.」[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]「Hey, Okarin! Mayushii just noticed something.」[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]「『Welcome back』 and 『Okarin』 go really well together!」[%p]
Whatever...[%p]
[name]Faris[line]「Kyouma! It's great that you came, nya!」[%p]
This maid, Faris NyanNyan – her professional name, of course – hits me with her trademark combo attack of cute cat‐like gestures.[%p]
She's MayQueen+Nyan²'s most popular maid.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]「Daru‐nyan's here too. He's been waiting, nya.」[%p]
Daru frequents this cafe because he's got a crush on Faris.[%p]
I also have trouble dealing with this catgirl.[%p]
She always finds a way to best me.[%p]
[name]Faris[line]「Are you holding another secret meeting to overthrow the evil Organization, nya?」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「Uh, yeah, something like that.」[%p]
[name]Faris[line]「Faris wants to join too, nya!」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「No chance. The Organization isn't threatened by cat‐eared maids.」[%p]
[name]Faris[line]「Not true, nya. Faris has the purrfect secret technique to help take them down.」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「What!? You've finally mastered [color index="850000"]that[color index="800000"] secret technique!?」[%p]
[name]Faris[line]「Yes, nya... After completing my pilgrimage to the Guiana Highlands and overcoming my mentor's death, I finally mastered it.」[%p]
[name]Faris[line]「So Faris wants to participate in the Spirit Conference like you promised, nya!」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「You're not suggesting we venture to the Sanctuary!?」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「The answer is no. Although you may understand the Hidden Secrets, you're still too inexperienced.」[%p]
[name]Faris[line]「But... but you promised, nya! Are you going to betray me!?」[%p]
[name]Faris[line]「My brother is waiting for me there...」[%p]
Since when do you have a brother!? And what the hell's this Spirit Conference anyway?[%p]
Whenever I talk with her, I run out of comebacks, which is really unusual for me.[%p]
And then she takes the initiative, leaving me with nothing to do but listen to her fantasies.[%p]
I mean, come on, you can only take it so far.[%p]
There's a very clear difference between her stories and mine.[%p]
As anyone can see, I speak nothing but the truth, while Faris has only delusions and a made‐up backstory![%p]
I always have to play along.[%p]
That's why I feel like I can never best her.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]「Umm, I don't quite get it, but can Mayushii go to the Sanctuary too?」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「You can't come. This discussion is over.」[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]「Ehhh?」[%p]
[name]Faris[line]「No fair, Kyouma!」[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]「That's right! Leaving Mayushii and Feris‐chan behind is mean!」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「...Who's is 『Feris』?」[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]「Feris‐chan is Feris‐chan. Right?」[%p]
[name]Faris[line]「Right!」[%p]
Is she talking about this Faris? Is that her real name? Have I been mistaken all this time?[%p]
That's a disturbing thought...[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]「Well, Mayushii has a hard time saying Faris, so I call her Feris‐chan instead!」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「Oh, so that's it.」[%p]
[name]Faris[line]「It's like we're in a girl's school. That's not too... [color index="850000"]tabby[color index="800000"].」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「Show me to the table already. How long do you want me to stand here waiting?」[%p]
[name]Faris[line]「Nyahaha! Sorry, nya. Table for two, this way, nyan♪」[%p]
She guides me to Daru's table.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]「You're way late. Seriously, man.」[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]「So, what were you just talking about with Faris? I want details.」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「...You really want to know? I don't think you'd understand it.」[%p]
Hell, even I didn't get most of it.[%p]
It's nothing more than an amalgam of fantasy and delusion.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]「Ah, the usual...」[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]「Your conversations are too much for regular [color index="820000"]otaku[color index="800000"]. You guys exude an aura or something, you know?」[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]「It's like you too have your own [color index="820000"]Reality Marble[color index="800000"]! You know I can't forgive you!」[%p]
I'm not even close to keeping up with her.[%p]
It's from Lukako.[%p]
Should I reply?[%p]
I don't have time for this right now.[%p]
There. That should do it.[%p]
It's Lukako again. Is he bored?[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]「So, what did you need?」[%p]
That's right.[%p]
In my confrontations with Shining Finger and Catgirl, I almost forgot my original objective.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]「I was gonna head to the lab in about an hour.」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「I have an urgent matter to discuss. Top secret.」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「You remember John Titor?」[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]「...John Titor? Who's that?」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「The self‐proclaimed time traveler who appeared on the internet about 10 years ago. I thought we talked about him before.」[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]「Is this a new addition to your made‐up backstory?」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「It's nothing like that! Everything I say is the truth!」[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]「What a pain. Well, I guess I can play along.」[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]「So, what's the source on this Titor guy being from the future?」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「Wait, you've seriously never heard about him before?」[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]「Seriously, bro, I haven't.」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「Sure you didn't just forget?」[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]「I can't say for sure.」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「There are even books about him.」[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]「I might remember if you show me one.」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「You really don't remember?」[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]「Memories fade. We're not computers, man.」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「...」[%p]
I remember talking to Daru about John Titor back in high school. It was only idle talk, so it's possible that Daru forgot about it.[%p]
Daru's quite the internet addict, after all.[%p]
And the internet lets you choose what information you want to see. There's no guarantee Daru looked up info on John Titor.[%p]
If he had, I doubt he would have forgotten so completely.[%p]
Is it my memories that are mistaken, or everyone else's?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「Then what about the IBN 5100?」[%p]
I show him the picture Shining Finger sent me.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]「Woah, you know about that? Cool.」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「So you know about it?」[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]「It's the model IBN released back in 1975.」[%p]
That's right. The John Titor from 10 years ago mentioned that on an American message board.[%p]
He traveled to 1975 first, obtained an IBN 5100, then leaped to 1998.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「What kind of computer is it?」[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]「The stupidly expensive kind.」[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]「Back when it came out, computers were so expensive that average people couldn't get their hands on them.」[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]「It was full of proprietary IBN technology, and was a pretty powerful computer for its time.」[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]「Then six years later, in 1981, IBN launched the popular IBN PC series. Now that's more famous.」[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]「Anyway, it's not like I'm an expert. This is just stuff I read on a [color index="820000"]wiki[color index="800000"].」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「Have you heard the urban legend that there's one in Akiba?」[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]「You bet I have. Just last month there was big talk about it on the net.」[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]「Some @channelers heard the rumors and went searching for it. My friend on [color index="820000"]FrePara[color index="800000"], Sister Centipede, was the main person behind that.」[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]「Even the legendary 『Neidhardt der Blitzschnelle』 joined the fray, but they still couldn't find it.」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「So it was just a hoax?」[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]「Who knows? There are tons of underground shops in Akiba. It wouldn't be strange if an IBN 5100 suddenly turned up in some hole in the wall.」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「Hmm. I see.」[%p]
My phone suddenly starts vibrating.[%p]
What's with this mail?[%p]
Disregarding the weird timing...[%p]
Is this really the gloomy, unsociable woman I met in front of Radi‐Kan?[%p]
I can't believe she's already so friendly, considering we've just exchanged addresses.[%p]
She's like a completely different person in this email. Does she have split personalities or something?[%p]
I tell Daru to wait a bit as I start typing out a response.[%p]
It's not like I trust her, but I figure I should tell her what I learned from Daru.[%p]
Message complete.[%p]
Ok, sent.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「Sorry for the wait, Daru.」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「So, there's one thing I need to know.」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「The IBN 5100 has the power to destroy the world, right?」[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]「What? It doesn't have the power to do anything, let alone destroy the damn world.」[%p]
[name]Faris[line]「What this, nya? The world's gonna be destroyed, nya?」[%p]
[name]Faris[line]「Master, thanks for waiting nyan nyan♪ Omelet rice, nyan!」[%p]
[name]Faris[line]「Please enjoy your meal before the world ends♪」[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]「Woah, 『The World is Doomed!!』 for the win! Faris's handwriting is so cute it puts my 『omelet』 in danger too!」[%p]
[name]Faris[line]「Daru‐nyan, Daru‐nyan, have you considered participating in the Faris Cup, nya?」[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]「Yeah, of course I'm participating!」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「Faris Cup? What's that?」[%p]
[name]Faris[line]「Next Sunday, we're hosting a RaiNet tournament at the cafe, nya!」[%p]
[name]Faris[line]「Faris is the event organizer. It's all my idea, nyan!」[%p]
[name]Faris[line]「You can participate too if you want, Kyouma! Entrance fee is 1000 yen and includes a drink. Whoever beats Faris gets to enjoy some of Faris' home‐cooking, nya.」[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]「It'll never happen. Okarin sucks at RaiNet.」[%p]
[name]Faris[line]「Nya? But it's so fun.」[%p]
Looking disappointed, Faris meowed her way back to the counter.[%p]
Not even mouthfuls of omelet rice could stop Daru's rambling about Faris. His passion is truly overwhelming.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]「Faris is one of the most skilled Rainetters I know.」[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]「She's gone undefeated in over 400 unofficial matches.」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「Is she Rickson Gracie?」[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]「It's so disappointing that Faris doesn't go to official tournaments. She'd win if she did, no doubt.」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「Why doesn't she?」[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]「I'm sure it's for the customers! She probably doesn't want to inconvenience the store. Truly a model maid.」[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]「Also, she's Mayushii's age, so she probably has school too.」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「She doesn't want to inconvenience the store, yet she's holding the Faris Cup here?」[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]「That doesn't matter at all!」[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]「The point is, Faris is cute, and cuteness is justice. Cute cat‐eared maids are sweet, if you know what I mean. And that's all that matters, right?」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「So in the end, do you bat for the 2D team, or the 3D team?」[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]「I dare say I'm bi!」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「You're an inspiration, Daru.」[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]「I know. I'm just too awesome.」[%p]
Daru usually doesn't show enthusiasm for anything. The exceptions are moe and Faris.[%p]
I wish he were this passionate about our experiments.[%p]
