[name]Rintaro[line]「They're gone...」[%p]
And it wasn't just the people on the street.[%p]
The people in the stores, gone. In the restaurants, gone. Even the cars vanished, drivers and all.[%p]
And it all happened in the blink of an eye.[%p]
Suddenly, an empty city spread before me.[%p]
Heat was rising from the asphalt in waves, but I felt only a cold chill down my spine.[%p]
Then, wandering through the deserted Akiba, I saw a satellite smashed into the rooftop of Radi‐Kan.[%p]
I just stood there, breathless, until–[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]「What's wrong?」[%p]
Mayuri's voice brought me back to reality.
Mayuri hadn't disappeared.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「E‐everyone disappeared just now, right!?」
[name]Mayuri[line]「Huh?」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「You saw it too, right!? Just now, before our very eyes!」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「Did you see it, Mayuri!? You saw it, right!?」[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]「Hmmm? Huhhhhh?」[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]「IIIII diiiiidn't seeeee anythiiiiing!」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「You... didn't?」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「You saw nothing? Nothing at all!? There were people here a second ago, weren't there!?」
[name]Mayuri[line]「...There were?」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「Even the store employees are gone! That's impossible by any measure!」[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]「Of course they are...」[%p]
Her reply didn't make any sense.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]「It was like this when we got here. Oh, I know! You're seeing things, aren't you?」[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]「I'm sure it's 'cause of the heat! Tutturu♪」[%p]
How could she laugh at a time like this?[%p]
I always thought she was a bit strange, but maybe her brain is actually broken.[%p]
I realized that she couldn't help me.[%p]
With nowhere else to turn, I looked up at the bright blue sky.
Naturally, my eyes drifted to the top floor of Radi‐Kan, where I had been just a moment before.[%p]
There it was. An enormous machine, like some kind of satellite, embedded in the roof of the building.[%p]
The same building where, just moments before, I had found Makise Kurisu's body in a pool of blood.[%p]
What happened to her?[%p]
Has anybody called an ambulance?[%p]
Just before everyone disappeared, I could've sworn I heard an ambulance siren.[%p]
Makise Kurisu might still be in that dark room – cold, bloody, and alone.[%p]
The thought disturbed me, but the question at the forefront of my mind was...[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「...What the hell is that satellite doing there?」[%p]
Satellite.[%p]
Right before Doctor Nakabachi's presentation, the building was shaken by an unknown force. The roof door lock had been broken, and beyond it sat a large, satellite‐like machine.[%p]
That's right. When I saw it, the object was neatly sitting 「on」 the rooftop.[%p]
But that's not what I was seeing now.[%p]
This satellite had penetrated the top floor of the building.[%p]
It looked as if it had completely obliterated the room where Doctor Nakabachi's press conference had been held.[%p]
It must have fallen out of orbit without burning up in the atmosphere, somehow.[%p]
I knew it was crazy, but what other explanation could there be?[%p]
The real question was...[%p]
When did that happen?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「Mayuri, about that satellite...」[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]「Yup. What a surprise, huh?」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「What do you mean? What was a surprise?」[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]「It made a huge 『kaplow』 sound!」[%p]
It certainly did make a sound.[%p]
But I don't think it was 「kaplow!」[%p]
I'd say it was more like 「Zzzzzznnnmmm.」[%p]
Like the roar of an earthquake.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「Did that satellite fall out of the sky?」[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]「Did it? Do you think any aliens were on board?」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「...」[%p]
Had I lost my mind?[%p]
What I had seen didn't match at all with what Mayuri was saying.[%p]
Suddenly, nothing seemed real. Had I dreamt it all?[%p]
I caught the attention of a policeman trying to cordon off the scene and tried to tell him about the stabbing of Makise Kurisu, but–[%p]
「No one got stabbed at Radi‐Kan,」 he annoyedly insists.[%p]
What? How could he say that with such certainty?
We were escorted up to [color index="820000"]UPX[color index="800000"] and released.[%p]
There were people at UPX, like usual.[%p]
And that brings us to the present.[%p]
I'm baffled.[%p]
Did the whole hour since the beginning of Nakabachi's presentation really happen?[%p]
I check online for any news.[%p]
The net is buzzing about the mysterious machine that crashed into Radi‐Kan.[%p]
Nobody has mentioned anything about the disappearance of hundreds of people from Akiba's streets, nor about Makise Kurisu's murder.[%p]
It's all a mystery.[%p]
...A mystery?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「I see... so that's it!」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「This is all an elaborate coverup by the Organization! Their influence has corrupted local law enforcement, which means our entire government may already be under their control. My god!」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「But they underestimated me, for I am not so easily played. One day, I will expose their deeds and put an end to their reign!」[%p]
Having come to a satisfactory conclusion, I take a celebratory bottle of Dr P – my favorite soda – from the fridge.
[name]Rintaro[line]「Ah, [color index="850000"]elixir intellectualis[color index="800000"], a drink fit for a genius!」[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]「Cola's better.」[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]「Okarin really loves his Dr P!」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「I pity the man who knows not the greatness of this beverage! Muhahaha!」[%p]
