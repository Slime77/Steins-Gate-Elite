[name]???[line]「Oh?」[%p]
[name]???[line]「That looks like an interesting experiment.」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「Who's there!?」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「Impossible! What are [color index="850000"]you[color index="800000"] doing here!?」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「The 18‐year‐old genius girl! A sadist who humiliates men in public! Also known as The Zombie!」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「Makise... Kurisu!」[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]「Nice exposition, bro.」[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]「Who are you calling a zombie?」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「What is the meaning of this!? What is your purpose here?」[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]「I'm here to see you, Okabe Rintaro‐san. Or is it Hououin Kyouma‐san?」[%p]
Wait. How the hell does she know my real name?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「I was right! You're one of the Organization's top agents, an esper with superhuman powers!」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「No wonder you rose from the dead!」[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]「I'm not dead, alright? Please stop killing me off.」[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]「Hashida‐san, can you do something about this guy?」[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]「You came at a bad time, Makise‐shi, with Okarin freaking out like this.」[%p]
Daru doesn't seem fazed by this girl's entrance.[%p]
But why?[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「Have you betrayed me, Daru!?」[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]「Calm down, man.」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「Are you being blackmailed? Or did she seduce you?」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「YOU'VE CROSSED THE LINE, BIIITTCH!」[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]「Get ahold of yourself.」[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]「Hashida‐san gave me the address after yesterday's lecture. He also told me your name.」[%p]
Kurisu's simple explanation quells my fiery rage like a bucket of water.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「So you're here to see me, is that it?」[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]「Yes. You claimed to have seen me die. I came to see if that was the truth, or just a pathetic excuse to grope me. I came for the answer.」[%p]
Now that she mentions it, she did treat me like I was a perv yesterday.[%p]
Well... I suppose I should be grateful that she didn't call the cops on me after what I did.[%p]
But what choice did I have? Anybody would react the same way if a dead person reappeared before them. Right?[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]「But your current behavior is all the answer I need. It was all an act to grope me. My initial hypothesis was correct.」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「Not so fast. There's more to this than you know.」[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]「Anyway, let's put that aside for now.」
[name]Kurisu[line]「I haven't properly introduced myself yet, have I? I'm Makise Kurisu. Pleased to meet you.」[%p]
What is she trying to do?[%p]
Shoot lightning from her fingertips!?[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]「You can't even shake hands? Are all Japanese men this difficult?」[%p]
Shake hands?[%p]
This girl genius is asking for a handshake? We only met yesterday, and just moments ago she was on the verge of calling the cops.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「You're not Japanese!?」[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]「I've lived in America for seven years. What about it?」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「America...」[%p]
I look down at her slender fingers.[%p]
Glossy, healthy fingernails. No unnecessary nail polish.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]「What's your problem?」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「I can feel your aura of malice. You must be a powerful kung‐fu master.」[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]「Don't be ridiculous.」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「Then you're a NINJA–」[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]「Give it a rest.」[%p]
Damn, this woman is completely cold. Her tone gets scary sometimes, too.[%p]
And to top it all off, she bursts into the lab and starts inspecting our gelbana without permission.[%p]
I slowly sneak toward the PhoneWave (name subject to change)., trying not to draw her attention to myself.[%p]
The last thing I want is Kurisu getting close to the PhoneWave (name subject to change).[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]「...Fascinating.」[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]「Have any forceps?」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「No!」[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]「Oh.」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「What are you doing!? That's precious data!」[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]「It's squishy.」[%p]
Kurisu licks the gel off her fingertip without any hesitation.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]「...No taste.」[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]「Gross.」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「You have quite the appetite, I see. A side‐effect of the resurrection, perhaps? If you're that hungry, I guess I could give you a banana or two!」[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]「No thanks.」[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]「Either way, those bananas are Mayushii's.」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「Come, don't be shy. This is an offering. Take it!」[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]「As if. Who would eat some perv's banana?」[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]「A perv's banana...!」[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]「Eat... a perv's banana... squishy... finger in mouth... 『Gross!』 with a sour expression...」[%p]
Looks like his cranial pervert processor is overclocking.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]「Um, can you say that one more time? With a more humiliated expression, if you please.」[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]「Huh?」[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]「Come on. Say, 『Who would eat some perv's banana?』 but if you could add an, 『Ahh, but it's so...』 after that, it would be extra delicious!」[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]「Huh? ...huh?」[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]「...Ah!!」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「Muhaha! Oh, Daru. You may be a worthless, disgusting perv, but let me say, well done, sir!」[%p]
Now to follow up for maximum combo![%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「So, Makise Kurisu. You just imagined something, didn't you? By all means, tell us what. Don't be shy. Muhahaha!」[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]「Why you...」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「Come on! Say it, genius girl! What's the imagination of a genius like? I'd love to hear from you!」[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]「You... ass!」[%p]
Looks like she's capable of expressing human emotion after all.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]「I get it. You're [color index="850000"]both[color index="800000"] pervs.」[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]「Well... you [color index="850000"]could[color index="800000"] say that.」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「I don't want to hear that from you.」[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]「Okay! If I came off as a little rude, I apologize.」[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]「I was only acting that way because you molested me, but I'll ignore that for now.」[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]「Please tell me what happened to this banana. I'd also like to hear about that...」[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]「That microwave thing.」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「That's top secret. The one thing I'm cleared to share with unauthorized individuals is that its name is the PhoneWave (name subject to change).」[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]「I couldn't care less about its name.」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「I'm afraid that's the only information you're cleared for.」[%p]
Daru and I discussed whether or not we should tell her anything more.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]「Hold on, Okarin. Makise‐shi might be able to explain what's going on.」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「Hmm... well...」[%p]
She is a genius.[%p]
She would have to defeat my sharp wit. We can trust her intellect at least.[%p]
But it's hard to stomach her attitude.[%p]
Then, I get a great idea.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]「That creepy grin... are you thinking perverted thoughts again?」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「You said your name's Christina, right?」[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]「Who the hell's Christina!? I never said that!」[%p]
『Christina』 sounds like the name of a Hollywood film star. It definitely has more flavor than her real name.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「If you wish to learn the secrets of this microwave, then you must meet my conditions.」[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]「...Which are?」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「Condition One: You must become a [color index="850000"]lab mem[color index="800000"].」[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]「Ramen?」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「No! Lab mem, stupid! Short for laboratory member!」[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]「You mean you want me to join your research team? I'm supposed to return to America in August.」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「I'll have you sign a non‐disclosure agreement so you won't betray our secrets. Break the agreement, and I'll report your steamy, perverted acts to Science Magazine.」[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]「Gh...」[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]「You're a monster, Okarin. I'll take five copies.」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「The second condition is...」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「That you'll overlook all past acts of molestation I may or may not have committed!」[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]「...」[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]「Okarin, you're so petty! You're the pettiest person I've ever met! [color index="820000"]That's why we love you! That's why we admire you![color index="800000"]」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「Those are the conditions!」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「If you can't accept them, then you must leave at once!」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「Heh heh heh. So what'll it be? I don't think it's a bad deal at all.」[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]「You mean for you.」[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]「Geez... I feel like I'm hypersecreting [color index="820000"]noradrenaline[color index="800000"]. Let me pick my jaw up off the floor.」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「I don't care about your dislocated jaw! Do you accept the conditions or not? Answer me, Christina!」[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]「Stop adding ‐tina! My name's Kurisu!」[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]「...Okay. I accept.」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「Hehehe, good answer.」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「From this moment forth, you are Lab Mem Number 004.」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「Welcome, Christina – codename, The Zombie!」[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]「I won't answer to either. Use my real name, Hououin.」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「...」[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]「...」[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]「You're such a child.」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「You say something? Genius [color index="850000"]perv[color index="800000"] girl?」[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]「Come on! No more saying 『perv』! I won't treat you like a perv either! So let's drop it already!」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「As long as you understand. Now for the issue at hand. Daru, give Christina–」[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]「No 『‐tina』 either.」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「Give Kurisu‐kun an explanation on our experiments so far.」[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]「[color index="820000"]But I refuse.[color index="800000"]」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「...」[%p]
In the end, I'm the one who has to explain. Along the way, I also relate the tale of my heroic deeds – which enrages Kurisu, of course – but I finally tell her everything about the bananas and the PhoneWave (name subject to change).[%p]
Kurisu doesn't ask any questions. She's quick to understand, as expected of a genius.[%p]
It's from Mayuri. I don't have time to reply right now, so I'll just ignore it.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]「Fascinating.」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「Let's hear your opinion.」[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]「I think we can at least throw out [color index="850000"]completely worthless[color index="800000"] theories like electromagnetic weaponry and teleportation.」[%p]
The lady doth protest too much.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]「Can we run the experiment one more time? I want to see it for myself.」[%p]
It's strange.[%p]
It seems as though Kurisu is really enjoying herself.[%p]
But I mean, she is a scientist. Why shouldn't she enjoy experimenting?[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]「Okabe‐san, Hashida‐san, please watch the bananas.」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「Who are you to give me orders? I am the mad scientist, Houou–」[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]「Whatever. Just keep your eye on the bananas!」[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]「Sixty seconds have passed. Any change?」[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]「Nope.」[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]「100 seconds.」[%p]
A few moments after Kurisu's report–[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]「Ah!」[%p]
It happened faster than the blink of an eye.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]「It appeared!」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「...」[%p]
I'm at a loss for words.[%p]
This phenomenon is clearly teleportation.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]「...」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「How does it look?」[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]「Huh? Oh... uh...」[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]「A‐at 104 seconds, it d‐disappeared. Abruptly. Yeah.」[%p]
She's quite flustered.[%p]
I don't think many people could remain calm after witnessing such a phenomenon.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「So it is a teleporter! The first in human history!」[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]「...」[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]「Teleportation... is that even possible?」[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]「It did move... No matter how unbelievable that may be...」[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]「Could it be [color index="820000"]quantum teleportation[color index="800000"]... no, that only occurs on the quantum level...」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「Don't avert your eyes from the truth! What you've seen with your own eyes is everything!」[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]「Did it really teleport? It's dangerous to reason from the conclusion.」[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]「Hmm... I need a clue...」[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]「Anything else? Have you noticed anything else about the PhoneWave?」[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]「Oh, right!」[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]「One time, it shot off a huge electrical discharge.」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「What!? I don't know anything about that!」[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]「That's because you weren't around when it happened.」[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]「Discharge? How much?」[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]「It was like a fluorescent light lit up the development room. It lasted about two seconds, I guess.」[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]「What were the circumstances?」[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]「I was adjusting the cellphone attached to it. I unhooked it and put my own in.」[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]「A little bit later, sparky sparky.」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「When was that?」[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]「Around noon yesterday. When you went to see Doctor Nakabachi's presentation.」[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]「Doctor Nakabachi...」[%p]
That's right. I went to see Doctor Nakabachi's conference yesterday.[%p]
Come to think of it, he stole his time travel theory from John Titor.[%p]
Maybe the current John Titor is actually Nakabachi.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「But wait, Daru. Didn't you say that Doctor Nakabachi's presentation was cancelled?」[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]「Yeah, but you went with Mayu‐shi anyway, remember?」[%p]
...No, I don't remember that.[%p]
After all, Nakabachi's presentation wasn't canceled, the way I remember it.[%p]
I still don't understand why my memories seem to disagree with everyone else's.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「That reminds me. I sent Daru an email that day.」[%p]
But for some reason, his phone received it on July 23rd – five days prior.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]「Huh? Wasn't that one of your stories? If it wasn't, then that would make the timestamp weird.」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「I always speak the truth! If you don't trust me, I'll show you my send history.」[%p]
But–[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「It's gone...」[%p]
It should be there, but it isn't.[%p]
Just like the banana inside the PhoneWave (name subject to change).[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「Where did it go? I could've sworn I sent it just before 1 PM.」[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]「Oh yeah! That's when the discharge phenomenon happened! The show I was watching was about to end.」[%p]
Suddenly, a flash of inspiration strikes.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「I get it... So that's what happened.」[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]「Uh, what?」[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]「Oh, this is one of Okarin's usual habits, so don't mind it. Seriously.」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「Silence! I've reached the answer, and now the world will tremble!」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「The disappearance of my mail, the strange timestamp, and the sudden electrical discharge must be...」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「Related somehow!」[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]「...」[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]「...」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「...」[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]「...And?」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「Huh?」[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]「I understand that they're related somehow. But how?」[%p]
Whatever. I'll prove that I'm right.[%p]
If we can reproduce the electrical discharge phenomenon, it should bring us closer to understanding the timestamp mystery.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「Daru, describe the PhoneWave (name subject to change)'s status when the discharge phenomenon occurred.」[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]「It was kind of a mess. I'd connected my phone to the PhoneWave, and I was testing to see if I could control it with the X68000.」[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]「Time to eat some chicken!. Juicy Chicken Number One♪」[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]「I'm home! So hungry...」[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]「Okarin, did you buy the bananas? Okarin?」[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]「Huh? We have a guest?」[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]「I'm Mayushii. Nice to meet you!」[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]「I'm Makise. Apparently, I'm a lab mem now.」[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]「Really? That's great! Another girl lab mem!」[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]「Oh no, Mayushii's bananas!」[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]「They turned into gelbanas...」[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]「We used them for an experiment.」[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]「But they were Mayushii's...」[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]「Don't worry, Mayushii‐san, you'll be repaid later. By Hououin‐san.」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「Why me!?」[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]「Geez. Why do you always do experiments with Mayushii's food?」[%p]
Mayuri's complaint falls on deaf ears. This is all to reign victorious against 「The Organization.」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「Daru, what were you doing with the X68000?」[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]「Like I said, I was adjusting the incoming mail settings. I was monitoring the moment it received mail for remote control.」[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]「That's why I put it on 『freezing mode』 for 120 seconds too.」[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]「I made it so that you can start freezing mode by computer. I tested that out yesterday too.」[%p]
Daru explains what everything on the computer monitor means.[%p]
Doesn't look that different from using [color index="820000"]DOS[color index="800000"].[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「Mayuri, put the Juicy Chicken Number One into the PhoneWave (name subject to change)!」[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]「Do you guys want some chicken? I can give you one each.」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「So, we've reproduced the conditions that existed when the discharge phenomenon occurred. Right?」[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]「Uhh, how was it again...」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「You there. Assistant!」[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]「When did I become your assistant!?」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「Just send something to my phone!」[%p]
If we've reproduced the conditions correctly, then if she sends something to my phone while it's connected to the PhoneWave (name subject to change), it should arrive with a timestamp from the past, not the present.[%p]
But my assistant – Kurisu – just scowls.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]「I don't even know your email address.」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「What a useless assistant.」[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]「Don't call me your assistant!」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「Daru, send an email from your phone!」[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]「Uh, sure... but what?」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「Anything!」[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]「Uhh, umm...」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「Send 『Christina's a perv』!」[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]「I thought we agreed to stop saying that!」[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]「Well, let's compromise and go with 『Okarin's a perv』.」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「You traitor!」[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]「Good job, Hashida‐san!」[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]「Want me to send the mail now?」[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]「Ah! Don't tell me you're experimenting on the chicken too?」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「We are.」[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]「'Kay, sending it now」[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]「Sending, sending, click.」[%p]
Then, unable to wait, Mayuri slips past me and tries to open the PhoneWave (name subject to change)'s door–.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「Wait! Don't open that!」[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]「Huh?」[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]「Wawah!」
[name]Kurisu[line]「An electrical discharge!」[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]「*cough cough*」
[name]Rintaro[line]「E‐everyone okay?」[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]「S‐somehow.」[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]「That was definitely more than two seconds.」[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]「O‐Okarin? Umm, what just happened?」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「Are you okay? No burns or anything?」[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]「Hmm... It doesn't hurt anywhere, so I think I'm okay...」[%p]
Looks like covering Mayuri was the right choice.[%p]
Whew. Well, that was something.[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]「H‐hey! Look at this!」[%p]
Kurisu's voice is strained.[%p]
The smoke that filled the room finally dissipated, making the entire development room visible once more.[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]「What the hell? How did that... Yeah, it's a microwave, but it's not heavy enough to make a hole in the floor...」[%p]
[name]Kurisu[line]「This can't be caused by electrical discharge. Some other phenomenon?」[%p]
[name]Itaru[line]「...So, about Mayu‐shi's chicken.」[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]「Eh?」[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]「Ahh! M‐Mayushii's chicken is all burnt black...」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「Juicy Chicken Number One made a noble sacrifice for the progress of science. Let us pray for his happiness in the next life.」[%p]
As I said that, my eyes settled on my cell phone.[%p]
That's right![%p]
My heart pounding, I detach my phone from the PhoneWave (name subject to change).[%p]
Luckily, it's completely unharmed.[%p]
I open it. It still works.[%p]
I bring up the list of received emails.[%p]
New emails should come at the top.[%p]
However...[%p]
My heart beats even faster.[%p]
The topmost email isn't the one Daru sent before the discharge occurred.[%p]
This 「impossible」 phenomenon is exactly what I was hoping for.[%p]
I look back through my email history.[%p]
And there...[%p]
Finally...[%p]
I find it.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「Muhaha! Muhahaha! MUHAHAHAHA!」[%p]
Success. I don't know why, but it was a success![%p]
The timestamp proves it.[%p]
I received this email on July 24th – five days ago.[%p]
This is the same exact thing that happened to my 「someone stabbed Kurisu」 email.[%p]
A mail sent on the 29th arrived on the 24th.[%p]
And just now, the truth was revealed to me in a flash of inspiration.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「It all connects. There's a meaning behind this series of events, and only one true answer.」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「I've discovered the PhoneWave (name subject to change)'s true hidden function!」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「This isn't intuition. That's right. This is conviction!」[%p]
