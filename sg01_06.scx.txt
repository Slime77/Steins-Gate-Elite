I ended up listening to all of Kurisu's lecture at ATF.[%p]
After the two time travel theories she introduced at the beginning, she explained the rest with equal eloquence.[%p]
She seemed a little nervous at first, but that quickly changed as she spoke. By the end, it was an impressive lecture. So impressive that you wouldn't think it was an 18‐year‐old's first time.[%p]
She did well to respond to my malicious questions with sarcasm. She's got guts.[%p]
Wait, why am I praising her!?[%p]
Leaving that aside...[%p]
I saw Makise Kurisu dead.[%p]
And yet she is alive.[%p]
My memories don't mesh with reality.[%p]
And not just my memories of Kurisu, but also my conversations with Mayuri.[%p]
Daru, too. Everything that happens in this reality stands in stark opposition to the world I remember.[%p]
Everything would be solved if I just told myself that what I saw was a dream. An illusion. It never happened.[%p]
By the time I had snapped out of my internal monologue, Daru had wandered off. So be it.[%p]
I need to focus on finding a way to discover the true cause of my contradicting memories anyway.[%p]
...This leaves me with no choice.[%p]
I arrive at Yanabayashi Shrine.[%p]
I need to get exorcised.[%p]
I seriously doubt that the Makise Kurisu at ATF was a ghost.[%p]
Regardless, it's natural to seek an exorcism after such an experience. I'm Japanese. It's in our blood.[%p]
Yanabayashi Shrine is located on the other side of Kanda River. To find it, enter the first side road after crossing Manseibashi Bridge. It's a very small shrine that doesn't fit with the surrounding multi‐tenant buildings.[%p]
Kanda Myojin is the more famous shrine in Akiba, but I deliberately chose this one.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]「It's Okarin! Tutturu♪」[%p]
There are two girls standing in front of the main building.[%p]
One is Mayuri, and the other is docile‐looking beauty wearing traditional [color index="820000"]miko[color index="800000"] attire[%p]
Urushibara Luka.[%p]
The chief priest's son.[%p]
Lovely in every way... but he's a guy.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]「Good afternoon, Okabe‐san.」[%p]
We met when I rescued him from some aggressive photographers in Akiba's [color index="820000"]Pedestrian Heaven[color index="800000"].[%p]
It also so happens that Lukako and Mayuri are classmates.[%p]
I learned that fact after I had gotten to know him.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「Are you practicing with Samidare like I told you?」[%p]
[name]Luka[line]「Y‐yes...」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「As long as you master the Seishin Zanma school of swordsmanship, you can prevent the dark flame inside you from consuming your soul.」[%p]
Demon Sword Samidare may be an imitation sword, but that is only the form it takes to hide from the world.[%p]
When one worthy to wield it appears, it unleashes its true power.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]「I really appreciate this, Okabe‐san.」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「My name isn't Okabe.」[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]「It's Okarin!」[%p]
[name]Luka[line]「I'm sorry, Kyouma‐san.」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「As long as you understand. Now, speak the words.」[%p]
[name]Luka[line]「Ah, umm. El... Psy... Kongaloo...?」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「No! Not Kongaloo! Kongroo!」[%p]
[name]Luka[line]「Y‐yes!」[%p]
[name]Luka[line]「El... Psy... Kongroo.」[%p]
[name]Luka[line]「D‐did I get it right?」[%p]
Lukako smiles happily as I nod.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]「Thank you.」[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]「Such a beautiful master‐disciple relationship. Mayushii's not a [color index="820000"]fujoshi[color index="800000"], but she's getting a little excited.」[%p]
[name]Luka[line]「Ehh!? M‐Mayuri‐chan, please don't imagine such things...」[%p]
Geez.[%p]
Though we do have a master‐disciple relationship.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「What are you doing here, Mayuri?」[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]「I came to see Luka‐kun.」[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]「[color index="820000"]ComiMa[color index="800000"]'s coming up next month, and I want him to cosplay as [color index="820000"]Kirari‐chan[color index="800000"] from RaiNet. But he won't say yes...」[%p]
[name]Luka[line]「But, cosplaying... that's just too embarrassing for me...」[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]「But I'm sure you'll look great in it!」[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]「The phrase 『[color index="820000"]someone this cute can't be a girl[color index="800000"]』 is really popular, you know? C'mon, make your cosplay debut!」[%p]
Mayuri's hobby is making costumes. She's made at least thirty so far, but it's rare for her to wear one herself.[%p]
Instead, she seems to get her kicks from seeing other people wear them.[%p]
And it looks like she's chosen Lukako as her next target.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「Anyway, Lukako. There's a good reason for my being here today. I need you to perform an exorcism.」[%p]
[name]Luka[line]「An exorcism? Then I'll go get my dad. Please wa–」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「No, it's nothing that serious. I just need some peace of mind.」[%p]
That's why I came here instead of Kanda Shrine.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「So with that said, bring out the usual.」[%p]
[name]Luka[line]「Um, the usual...?」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「The usual for an exorcism should be obvious!」[%p]
[name]Luka[line]「Uhh... um...?」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「I don't know what it's called, but it's that stick with the zigzaggy paper thingies that the priest does a shaky thingy with!」[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]「Ahaha! That sounded really dumb, Okarin!」[%p]
Quite a shock to hear that from Mayuri.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「Guh! It's the evil spirit... in my arm!」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「Be still, foul spirit! Guh... Hurry, Lukako! It's trying to take over!」[%p]
[name]Luka[line]「N‐no way! Please hang in there, Okabe‐san!」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「I'm not Okabe‐san!」[%p]
[name]Luka[line]「I'm sorry, Kyouma‐san! Ahh, but what should I...」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「The exorcism... hurry! Just do it... like I taught you!」[%p]
[name]Luka[line]「O‐okay!」[%p]
[name]Luka[line]「Ummm... ummm...」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「Please... Luka... expel... this spirit... from me...」[%p]
[name]Luka[line]「Uuh...」[%p]
Reason tells me he's a guy, but his lovely appearance makes me feel guilty. Like I made a frail girl cry.[%p]
The voice of a girl. The mannerisms of girl.[%p]
More feminine than any girl I know.[%p]
But he's a guy.[%p]
Taller than Mayuri. Yet oh so slender.[%p]
But he's a guy.[%p]
Looks stunning in miko robes.[%p]
But he's a guy.[%p]
It's almost evening, yet still hot as hell outside.[%p]
But he's a guy.[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「...I'm okay. Looks like you drove away the evil spirit. Good job, Lukako.」[%p]
With a sigh of relief, I offer Lukako my thanks.[%p]
[name]Luka[line]「I'm glad I was able to help.」[%p]
Lukako gave us some corn on the cob, and Mayuri and I left Yanabayashi Shrine.[%p]
Though this corn was originally sent to Lukako's home, Lukako offered to share it with the lab after it proved to be too much for his family to eat.[%p]
We truly owe Luka for providing us with these valuable supplies.[%p]
Still fired up after Lukako's exorcism, Mayuri swung her bag of corn about like a sword.[%p]
Not that I could blame her. I was excited myself.[%p]
We tried taking a shortcut, but found our path blocked off.[%p]
Reasonable, I suppose, given that the bridge led to Radi‐Kan.[%p]
With our progress halted, Mayuri takes out her pocket watch to check the time.[%p]
It's a very old watch, not the sort you'd expect a high school girl to carry.[%p]
Its name is Pockety.[%p]
Ever since elementary school, Mayuri has carried Pockety with her everywhere.[%p]
It's her most important treasure.[%p]
If she's concerned about the time, it must mean she has to go to work soon.[%p]
Without saying a word, I extend my hand to Mayuri, offering to take the corn back to the lab myself.[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]「Thanks.」[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]「Well, time for me to go to work!」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「Wait, Mayuri. Back at Radi‐Kan, you heard a man scream, right?」[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]「Scream?」[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]「When was that again?」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「This afternoon.」[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]「I don't think I heard anything...」[%p]
[name]Rintaro[line]「...Oh. Well, alright.」[%p]
[name]Mayuri[line]「Okarin's a weirdo!」[%p]
